Currently I've been reading two books (well, sort of three): "Hot Water Music" by Charles Bukowski and "Italian Folktales" by Italo Calvino, with the third being some of Grimm's fairy tales. The contrasts between the fairy tales and Bukowski's short stories are obvious and large, but what I find striking is how they are similar in many ways as well.

Example: one of the things I find most interesting about the way fairy tales are written is their universalism, their very straightforward nature. They offer little explanation for events, and that doesn't seem to be a necessary component. Often, I catch Bukowski writing in a similar way. In both cases, they often seem to be just a recitation of events. I feel like this lends them both a timelessness, an impartiality to the events around them, that I find incredibly compelling.

Then, sort of reversing the two, I find myself occasionally bringing Bukowski's pessimistic outlook to the fairy tales, wondering if maybe fairy tales do pass on a bit of a negative view on the world they're set in. After all, sometimes really terrible things happen, even if later on they're righted.

Maybe doing this back-and-forth too much will end up messing me up...

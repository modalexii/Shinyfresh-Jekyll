1. List does not include local recurrent dance nights I have attended, including at least one night at each of the following:
Red Maple (Just For Heads)
Joe Squared (Dig)
Lithuanian Hall (Save Your Soul)
The Windup Space (4 Hours of Funk) x
2. Kool Keith did not play, as he got stuck in a snowstorm while traveling to the show.x
3. Electric Zoo was supposed to run until 9/1, but the third day was cancelled when two people who were never taught about safe drug use passed away.x
4. Official Electric Zoo afterparty. Best Buy had a great system.x
5. Upon the cancellation of the third day of Electric Zoo, our gracious host took us to a well-respected house music club whose name I cannot remember, and we had an amazing time dancing with the locals.x
6. Late show DJ set.x
7. I was lucky enough to attend the rehearsal for this performance, which actually took place on 10/31.x
8. I bought a ticket off of Craigslist for this show.x
